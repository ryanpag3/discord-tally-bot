Tally Bot is built around keeping track of _stuff_. Like, how many times your coworker is late for a meeting, or how many times your guild wipes at 1%. Whatever you want. It also supports announcing events as well as timing whatever you want. It's highly customizable and 99.99% highly available 24/7.

Have fun! Don't forget to provide feedback using `!tb bug` or `!tb suggest` (see below for more info).

## Tip Jar
If you like Tally Bot and would like to see its continued support and development, feel free 
to send some beer money [this way](https://paypal.me/ryanpage42)

This will help offset the cost of running the bot. Thank you ðŸ‘Š

## General

### **Get Help**
This will send you back here.


    ---- Server Examples ----

    !tb help


    ---- Direct Message Examples ----

    help

### **Invite Bot**
Get an invite link to add the bot elsewhere.

    ---- Server Examples ----

    !tb invite


    ---- Direct Message Examples ----

    invite

### **Make a Feature Request**
Want to see somethings added? Just use this command to open a request.

    !tb suggest [suggestion]

    ---- Server Examples ----

    !tb suggest Have you tried not sucking?

    ---- Direct Message Examples ----

    suggest Have you tried not sucking?

### **Make a Bug Report**
Use this to let me know if there is anything messed up with the bot.

    !tb bug [report]

    !tb report [report]


    ---- Server Examples ----

    !tb bug This bug is broken!

    !tb report It's still broken!


    ---- Direct Message Examples ----

    bug This bug is broken!

    report It's still broken!

## Permissions
On installation, Tally Bot will allow any user to run any command. Admins can set permissions for commands to allow only users with a certain role to run them.

### **Set All Permissions**
Set all permissions to a specific server role. Server administrators can _always_ run this.

    !tb -role [Role]

    ---- Server Examples ----
    !tb -role MyRole

### **Set A Specific Permission**
Set a permission for a specific command. Server administrators can _always_ run this.

    !tb [command] -role [Role]

    ---- Server Examples ----
    !tb bump -role MyRole

### **Display Permissions**
Display all current permissions.

    !tb permissions

    ---- Server Examples ----
    !tb permissions

### **Granting Permission Admin Access**
If you would like to grant users the ability to change permission levels, you can run the following. This is rather clunky and I have plans on improving this syntax, but it works. ðŸ˜‰

    !tb -role -role [Role]

    ---- Server Examples ----
    !tb -role -role MyRole

## Tallies

### **Channel vs Global**
Tallies are defined as *Channel Tallies* when initially created. You will see that identified by **[C]** in the relevant commands. You are also allowed to convert these to *Global Tallies* identified by **[G]**.

All relevent tally commands can be either used for channel tallies or global tallies. Simply add `-g` after the command.

**Note**: _This does not apply to direct message tallies._

For example, if I wanted to bump a **global** tally named *test*, I would issue this command

    !tb bump -g test



### **Create A Tally**
Create a tally that has a specified _name_ and _description_. A name is a unique identifier that is used to increase or decrease the tally's _count_. Tally counts can be positive or negative.

    !tb create [name] [description]
    -or-
    !tb add [name] [description]

    
    ---- Server Examples ----

    !tb create test-tally My tally that I will count things with.

    !tb add test-tally My tally that I will count things with.

    
    ---- Direct Message Examples ----

    create my-dm-tally I will count things... privately!

    add my-dm-tally I will count things... privately!

### **Create a Keyword Tally**
Create a tally that has all the attributes of the above regular tally, but can be configured to increase or decrease based off of a _keyword_. A keyword is a word (or words) that will trigger this event.

    !tb keyword [name] [keyword] [description]
    -or-
    !tb kw [name] [keyword] [description]

    
    ---- Server Examples ----

    !tb keyword my-kw-tally poisoned Trigger everytime someone has been poisoned.
    
    !tb kw my-kw-tally poisoned,cursed,dead Trigger everytime someone has been poisoned, cursed, or dies.

### **Create a Keyword Dump Tally**
This tally has all the attributes of a regular keyword tally, but will _decrease_ the tally when the keyword event is fired.

    !tb keyword dump [name] [keyword] [description]
    -or-
    !tb kw dump [name] [keyword] [description]

    ---- Server Examples ----
    !tb keyword dump my-kw-tally poisoned Trigger everytime someone has been poisoned.
    
    !tb kw dump my-kw-tally poisoned,cursed,dead Trigger everytime someone has been poisoned, cursed, or dies.

### **Make a Tally Globally Visible**
Convert a Tally to be globally scoped. If a tally already exists in the current global scope with the specified _name_ provided, then it will error.

    !tb global [name]

    ---- Server Examples ----
    !tb global my-tally

### **Make a Tally Channel Visible**
Convert a Tally to be channel scoped. If a tally already exists in the current global scope with the specified _name_ provided, then it will error.

    !tb channel [name]

    ---- Server Examples ----
    !tb channel my-tally

### **Change Tally Description**
Update a tally's description. Note, this will work on all tally types.

    !tb describe [name] [description]
    -or-
    !tb update [name] [description]


    ---- Server Examples ----

    !tb describe my-tally Wow a brand new tally description!

    !tb update my-tally Wow another brand new tally description!!! :)

    
    ---- Direst Message Examples ----

    describe my-tally Wow a brand new tally description!

    update my-tally Wow another brand new tally description!!! :)

### **Increase a Tally**
Tallies can be increased by one (default) or by an amount.

    !tb bump [name]
    -or-
    !tb bump [name] [amount]


    ---- Server Examples ----
